How to make a ReVAX release
---

I think everything is just committed to HEAD/MASTER all the time.  At least
in the beginning.

This is a frighteningly long checklist :(

It's probably going to take a few test releases before I get this reasonably
automated.



Write/update release notes
---



Check that all unit tests pass
---
make run-tests
make afl-run

(repeat on all platforms -- this is what continuous integration is for)

(check that the tests are useful: they should cover all lines)



Check that the source code is nice
---
make fixme -- check manually that it isn't *too* bad
make spaces
make reserved

(again, this is what continuous integration is for)



Check that everything builds
---
make distclean	-- careful!  don't do this in my own directory!
make all

(actually, build asm/dis/sim/uop both with sanitizers and assertions and without
them, just like 'make tests' and 'make tests-nosan')



Check remaining targets
---
make help
make cov
make snips
make misc
make vars
make clean



Check that things run ok
---
./revax-asm ...
./revax-dis ...
./revax-sim ...

do the same thing again with sanitizers:

./revax-asm ...
./revax-dis ...
./revax-sim ...

(check that the tests cover a reasonable part of asm/dis/sim/uop)



Check that everything is committed
---
hg status
git status



Tag the release version
---
hg XXXX?
git XXXX?



Make a tarball/zipfile
---
git archive -o revax-0.1.tar.gz --prefix=revax-0.1/ HEAD	-- or release tag
git archive -o revax-0.1.zip    --prefix=revax-0.1/ HEAD	-- ------"-------
hg archive revax-0.1.tar.gz



Check the tarball/zipfile
---
It should not be suspiciously big or small.
Verify with Midnight Commander that the directory structure in the tarball is correct

verify that it can be uncompressed
verify that it works:
  make
  make help
  make stats
  make spaces
  make fixme
  make reserved

  make all
  make snips
  make misc
  make tests
  make tests-nosan
  make afl-tests



Packages
---
build debian/ubuntu package  -- not for the first few versions
build Fedora/Red Hat package -- not for the first few versions
build Raspbian package       -- not for the first few versions



Upload to github as a released file
---
