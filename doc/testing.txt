ReVAX Testing
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Overview
---
Much of the code is quite pedestrian and easy to test -- furthermore, if it
were a little bit wrong, it would be easy to fix and in most cases also easy
to discover.

The hard-to-find bugs lurk in the microcode and in the operand decoding/
validation/disassembly/assembly and, since VAX floating-point is different
from IEEE fp, in the VAX floating-point routines.

The undefined sanitizers in gcc and clang are used during tests, to ensure that
the code stays within the (mostly unmarked) straight and narrow path of
portable and valid C code.

Apart from ...<what?>...


Some tests may crash -- in that case it is imperative to preserve output.
The easiest way is to output to stderr.  It's a bit harder to switch stdout to
line buffering but that's also pretty easy.

The code is ambivalent: some uses stderr, some uses stdout.  FIXME!

See SQLite for inspiration.



Manual vs automated
---
It is still *very* manual.  A few tests can run entirely automatically but
most can't.

Moreover, some tests are quite long-running and buildbot/jenkins might kill
the job too early!  (test-fp + everything with AFL.)



Test types
---
Built-in test cases, built-in random tests, built-in systematic tests (of lots
of bit patterns).

Output to stdout, compare with known-good output.

Fuzz testing -- with American Fuzzy Lop.  Use the built-in test patterns to
seed the fuzz testing.  Should also use the minimization tools provided with
American Fuzzy Lop... this is not implemented yet.

coverage -- to verify that the tests are comprehensive enough.

Mutation testing -- not implemented yet!

Todo: cycle through ALL 4-byte operands?  All 5-byte operands?
  op_asm/op_dis are too slow for that.
  Cycling through all 2-byte opspecs, though, should be eminently doable.

  Round-trip tests bytes-->string-->bytes?

VAX fp
---
VAX fp conversion to/from strings is tested separately in test-fp.c.  All 2^32
bit patterns that an F floating-point value can have are tested.  Many millions
of random D/G/H floating-point bit patterns + 100,000+ particularly sensitive
bit patterns are tested.  There is a single F floating-point value and no D/G/H
floating-point values that can't be round-tripped from bit pattern to string and
back.  All other values can round-trip to within 1ULP -- and this might be a
bug.  Maybe they should all be able to round-trip exactly?  Maybe there's a
rounding subtlety that is wrong in the code?

The VAX fp conversion routines are tested in misc/test-fp.c.



Operand handling
---
Operand encoding/decoding/validation code is machine-generated, based on a
short file containing a high-level specification.  The translation is completely
straight-forward: one line in the file corresponds to a pattern match attempt
in the generated code (each pattern match attempt taking multiple lines).
The linear top-to-bottom matching means that most generated code lines are
executed many times, so the risk of undiscovered bugs is quite small with
basic testing of all the addressing modes.

test-op ... <what?> ...



Assembler
---
only a barebones assembler implemented -- realized while writing it that
operand handling was a lot more involved than expected, switched gears to using
machine-generated code for it (which is pretty much done now!).  Haven't gotten
around to using the machine-generated operand handling in the assembler yet.

Haven't implemented near enough directives/pseudo-instructions yet.

NOT SYSTEMATICALLY TESTED YET!



Disassembler
---
only a barebones disassembler implemented -- realized while writing it that
operand handling was a lot more involved than expected, switched gears to using
machine-generated code for it (which is pretty much done now!).  Haven't gotten
around to using the machine-generated operand handling in the disassembler yet.

Sketched code to disassemble much, much smarter.  This is more or less required
for disassembling the ka655x.bin "BIOS".

Some of the current operand disassembly (regarding labels, and regarding
the way immediates are written) is primitive/incomplete.

NOT SYSTEMATICALLY TESTED YET!



µops
---
There is a tool ('uop') that translates from VAX assembler to µops.  It is useful
both for exploration of the µops system, for example creation for documentation
purposes, and for testing of the operand decoding for the simulator.

NOT WRITTEN YET!



Simulator
---
NOT SYSTEMATICALLY TESTED YET!



ALU
---
Not quite implemented yet.



Interrupt/exception handling
---
Not implemented yet.



Load/store, translation, access control, interlocked
---
Load/store (and unaligned access!) is barely implemented yet.



Bus access, devices
---
Bus access cycles + device support is not implemented yet.



Microcode
---
There is no microcode testing yet.



Address generation
---
Involves operand decoding AND microcode.  Not tested yet.



Test costs, errors found
---
test-big-int was easy and things Just Worked.

test-fp was difficult to write because it required understanding lots of general
floating-point details and lots of VAX floating-point details.  Also required
interfacing with the 'mpfr' library, which also took some time to figure out.

Required implementing nextafter() for VAX floating-point types.

test-dis-uop -- really quick to write and test, once I had figured out precisely
what the µop instruction set should look like.

Lots of little errors found with test-op, mainly in op_asm.  Took a long time
to write all the test cases.  Examples of errors found were:
 - parse.h, the way the API was used was often not quite right (not enough
   parse_begin/parse_rollback/parse_commit + parse_ok not always set to false
   where needed)
 - parse_bigint() was buggy/incomplete
 - parse_bigint(), didn't test correctly that the immediate fit into the
   appropriate number of bytes (all upper bits either 0 or 1)
 - parse_fp() wasn't written yet (but it was easy to write and no bugs were found in it)
 - parse_reg() used parse_symbol() (wrapped in transactions) to check individually
   for each register name -- with the result that 'r1' matched 'r11' with
   predictably bad results.
   Switched to parse_id() followed by linear search in array of register names.
   That worked immediately.
 - parse_lit6() had a couple of small bit shifting/masking errors
 - op_asm_vax() didn't use maximal munch -- it sometimes recognized didn't see
   the entire operand.  This was fixed by rearranging a few lines in operands.spec.
   I wasted a couple of days thinking I had to rewrite parts of operands.pl to
   generate smarter matching code -- and I was totally wrong.


op_dis turned out to be very quick and easy to test with very few problems found:
 - pcrel() wasn't written yet
 - expand_lit6() had two small bugs (h fp didn't shift the fraction quite
   enough + shifting the (signed) int8_t literal that much was undefined
   behaviour). 

op_sim, no bugs found, easy to test

op-val, no bugs found, easy to test

ALU -- NOT WRITTEN/TESTED YET
analyze -- NOT WRITTEN/TESTED YET

asm -- NOT WRITTEN/TESTED YET
dis -- NOT WRITTEN/TESTED YET
uop -- NOT WRITTEN/TESTED YET
sim -- NOT WRITTEN/TESTED YET



Conclusion
---
Unit tests are awesome!  Round-trip tests are awesome!  Testing all possible
values is awesome(if there are not too many of them)!  Lots of random tests are
awesome!  Output to stdout and comparison with known good output is awesome!

American Fuzzy Lop is awesome!

gcc/clang's sanitizers are awesome!

GNU Make and makefiles are not so awesome -- I should probably look into trying
'meson'.

Writing test code is really, really boring but the payoff is really, really nice.

Modifying test code is sweet and easy, once it's been written.
