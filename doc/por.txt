The View from Space
---
Run VAX code a single instruction at a time by turning them to sequences of
µinstructions.  All these µinstructions ultimately come from a microcode ROM,
but some of them have patched in values taken from the instruction, such as the
4 condition code bits for Bcc instructions or Rn/Rx/Imm for various addressing
modes.

The µinstructions resemble RISC instructions and try very hard not to do too
much at the same time.  This let's them be pipelined (good for hardware performance),
be JITted (good for software emulation), be analyzed (good for performance
models and other tools), and be implemented with very little complexity (good
for design time/budget).

There are several phases of µinstructions associated with a VAX macroinstruction.
First, there is an optional µpre flow, that loads operands into registers (there
are extra internal registers in this model, above and beyond the 16 architected
GPRs).  Then there is the µcore flow corresponding to the *actual* instruction.
This is optionally followed by µpost for writing results to a GPR or to memory.
The µpre flow actually consists of up to 6 µop flows, each handling a single
operand.  The µop flows do not interfere with each other: they write their data
to a different register for each operand (which is not read by any of the other
µop flows), they only modify GPR registers for autoinc/dec modes, the only
other registers they are allowed to modify are the two temporary registers t0 and t1.

The three flow phases communicate via the registers o1..o6, dst, dsthi, and of
course r0..r15.


The microcode is written in a simple assembly language in a single text file.

Almost everything is table-driven: how many operands each instruction has and
of what kind is something that the decoder looks up in a table.  There are
two Perl scripts that generate the tables and #define's used in the project,
one of them also assembles the microcode and the labels in it into two C arrays.
The output of the scripts are two C #include files and one Perl module.
There is also an assembler and a disassembler for the VAX instruction set.  Those
are also largely table-driven, using the same C #include files as the emulator.

The emulator code has very little shared dynamic state.  Things are written almost
in an applicative style, which should make for easy debugging.  It certainly
makes for some nice code.

Before decoding an instruction, internal flags are checked to see if there
interrupts or exceptions that should be served.



Current Status
---
It still can't run a single instruction.  It hasn't run a single instruction in
about 14 days, since the first day or two of prototyping.  The initial prototype
*could* run code, as long as only a handful of instructions were used with only
two or three addressing modes.  The prototype was successful by showing that
the overall architecture could work and that the complexity wouldn't be alarmingly
high.

There have been no big surprises except for how big the VAX architecture is and
how poorly some aspects of it have been documented.

There have been no showstoppers nor the faintest hint of any.

The main reason why there's been little progress for several days is that I have
been tired and overworked!

I am currently mostly done with the last seven-ish things on the to do list
before the CPU is nominally finished.  After that, there will be some I/O work
and the inevitable testing and bugfixing.

The problem is that I've been stuck on those seven-ish things for a week.  I have
made clear progress and I have revised some of my design decisions for the better
but still...



Code-driven
---
The initial prototype was fun to code because it gave me immediate feedback on
real code -- I tested it on 'ADDL3 R2, R3, R4'.

I really miss that feedback loop.

I spent a few days trying to see if I could get VMS binaries off a CD-ROM image
I had downloaded which turned out to be in ODS-2 format (VMS-specific).  I could,
but then the executable format seemed too complicated.

My alternatives regarding code-driven development:
 - hand-written bits'n'pieces
 - a VMS binary
 - a NetBSD binary
 - an old Unix/32V binary (Unix/32V is an old port of System 7 to the VAX from
   the PDP-11)
 - KA655x.bin
 - pieces I have "lifted" out of contex from, say, C compiler output

The binaries are probably too hard to get up and running.  The KA655x.bin "BIOS"
is one of my better bets, but I will probably run into systems programming too
soon.  The last idea, code lifted from C compiler output, is probably the best
one.  I wish I had thought of that a week or two ago :(



Plan of Record
---
The decoder looks at operand specs and sets Imm/Rn/Rx variables.  It returns
a compressed addressing mode number.

There is, in principle, a microcode label for the Cartesian product of <access
type> × <data length> × <addressing mode>.  In actual practice, there will be
about 13 standard µop flows + a handful of special ones.  For example, bit field
instructions treat bit vectors in registers different from bit vectors in memory.

The reduction from 6 × 4 × 10+ = hundreds to about 20 could happen in several
different ways, for example by having lots of labels to the same piece of
microcode.  My chosen way is to have the reduction happen in the decoder through
a table indexed by <access type>, <datalen>, and <addrmode> which returns a label/
microcode address.

The generation of this table will need a little help from uasm.pl.

access() doesn't have to do mapping yet.  It doesn't have to handle page crossing
yet.  It doesn't have to do naturally aligned access to I/O space yet.

We also don't need to handle interrupts and exceptions yet.

So just getting the decoder done and hooked up is enough to let us start
playing with Real Code.

So, I will get binutils up and running for VAX code (= compile from source).

I will get gcc up and running for VAX code (= compile from source).

I will compile to assembly, edit it into shape, assemble and link, and that will
be my test code.

This should let me gradually work my way through addressing modes and classes
of instructions, until only queues and OS instructions are left.
