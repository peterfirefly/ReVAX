The source code I've written for this project is licensed under GPL v2.

There are other source code and text files in the repository that are not
written by me and are not GPLv2 licensed.

My stuff is the build script (Makefile) and the source code in src/ and misc/,
and the (very simple) test programs in runtime/.

The other stuff is things like VAX microcode, documentation, FILES-11 (ODS-2)
readers (I have modernized one of them but those were just minor changes), and
assorted VAX binaries for testing purposes.

The VAX microcode and CVAX design documents (+ ka655x.bin) came from Bob
Supnik's SimH web site.  Bob Supnik wrote most of that microcode originally,
back in the 80's when he worked for DEC.

All my stuff should have a copyright/license header but I might have forgotten
to write one on all of them.  This should not be taken as an indication that
I didn't write that file or that I didn't intend it to be GPLv2 licensed.
